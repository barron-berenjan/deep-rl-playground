    "The learning algorithm implemented for this assignment is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09477.pdf\">TD3</a> which addresses the overestimation bias of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971\">DDPG</a> - an off-policy, actor/critic network that inherits concepts from Deep-Q Learning such as _Experience Replay_ and _Fixed Q-Targets_ to train environments with continuous action spaces. The main fundamental difference between TD3 and DDPG is the use of two critic networks to estimate Q-values, using the smaller of the two to form the targets in the Bellman error loss functions. Other differences include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - the use of noise to regularize target actions, used by the critic to estimate Q-values\n",
    " - delayed update of the actor network\n",
    "  \n",
    "For this assignment, I trained an agent using both __DDPG__ and __TD3__ and the learning plots are displayed below. DDPG took ~3500 episodes to complete the task (i.e. achieve an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes) and i found it difficult to settle on good hyper-parameters. Additionally, as can be seen, there is a lot of variance across episodes and the trajectory is not as smooth as TD3 which took ~442 episodes to complete the task! \n",
